# How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
I interpret user needs by taking the elements of them and making a list of technical requirements out of them. User stories help to provide a common template to make sure that each user's need is understood and easily able to be completed to a known level.

# How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I tend to approach developing programs by making a list of the things I want the program to accomplish and work from the most major elements to the simplest elements. In the future, I hope to better organize my development by creating user stories with clear and detailed requirements and objective criteria that must be met.

# What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member in software development means having good communication skills. This includes everything from being able to listen to other people's ideas, clearly communicate your thoughts, discuss issues calmly as well as commenting on your code cleanly. Another skill that is critical to being a good team member is being able to work on your own for some tasks but also being able to ask for help if you need it in addition to giving help if asked. The team as a whole cannot function without each member is fully able to rely on the other members of the team for support.
